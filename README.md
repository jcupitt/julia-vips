# julia-vips

Messing about with julia to see what a libvips binding might look like.

Try:

```
$ ./vips.jl ~/pics/k2.jpg
started libvips successfully!
libvips version = 8.13.0
built object Main.Vips.Images.Image(Ptr{Main.Vips.GObjects.GObject} @0x0000000001e91000)
width = 1450
built object Main.Vips.GValues.GValue(0, 0, 0)
running GC ...
done
```
